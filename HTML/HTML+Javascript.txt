Include Javascript Modules
==========================

Include Modules of JavaScript in an HTML page appears to be more challenging, than
doing the same in a simple NodeJS project. Here are few steps



Simplest Solution:
------------------

   Identify your script as module, as following

        <script src="index.js" type="module"></script> 

 You must make sure that in there is code that will be executed by defailt in your script file
 For instance:

 function main(){
    ...
 }
 
 ...
 
 main()  //This will be invoked by default, when you include the script in the HTML
 

Solution using code in HTML:
------------------------------

If code must be run in the HTML, then the solution above is not enough. Us this oneSolution

 Use 'import' Statement in HTML page.
 ===================================
  
  Include the Javascript file straight into the HTML page like:
  
   	 <script src="myScript.js"></script> 
  
  appears to give complications, when the js file is served as static file in Express.JS
  (Like   -->  app.use(express.static('public'));   // First version)
  
  
  Solution:
  ---------
  
  i) Use a "module" type and use the 'import' keyword to pull you javascript file
  
	   <script type="module">
		  import {sayHi } from './sayHi.js';

		  document.getElementById("targetControl").innerHTML = sayHi('John');
	  </script>
  
   ii) then, use  the 'export' keyword in your javascript file:
   
    (sayHi.js file)
     ...
     export function sayHi(user) {
       return `Hello, ${user}!`;
     }

   NOTE: The NodeJS synthax, like *** module.exports.x = something *** do not appear to work with
         straight HTML+Javascript
