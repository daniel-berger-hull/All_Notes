Include Javascript Modules
==========================

Include Modules of JavaScript in an HTML page appears to be more challenging, than
doing the same in a simple NodeJS project. Here are few steps


1 - Use 'import' Statement in HTML page.

  
  Include the Javascript file straight into the HTML page like:
  
   	 <script src="myScript.js"></script> 
  
  appears to give complications, when the js file is served as static file in Express.JS
  (Like   -->  app.use(express.static('public'));   // First version)
  
  
  Solution:
  ---------
  
  i) Use a "module" type and use the 'import' keyword to pull you javascript file
  
	   <script type="module">
		  import {sayHi } from './sayHi.js';

		  document.getElementById("targetControl").innerHTML = sayHi('John');
	  </script>
  
   ii) then, use  the 'export' keyword in your javascript file:
   
    (sayHi.js file)
     ...
     export function sayHi(user) {
       return `Hello, ${user}!`;
     }

   NOTE: The NodeJS synthax, like *** module.exports.x = something *** do not appear to work with
         straight HTML+Javascript
