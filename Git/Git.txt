Pull remote code to local machine
================================

1  git clone https://git-codecommit.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<YourRepoName>
 (cd <YourRepoName> folder)

3. git checkout development

4. git pull 

Additionally

5.  git checkout –B  ‘can give jira ticket number ex. PIM 311 ‘
6.  git push --set -upstream origin ‘PIM 311’

Step 5 and 6 are optional.



 To commit Changes:
 ==================

  1 - git status (Facultative)
    --> Should tell you that there are changes ready to be commited

  2 - git add .git 
     Mark all the files to be commited
 
  3 - git commit -m "write commit message here"
      Commit all the change (on your local git copy)

  4 - git push
      Finally, send the changes to the remove git repository



 Discard all local changes:
 ==========================

  To remove all your changes, and go back to the orignial content
  (like it is on the remove branch)

   git reset –-hard        (That one apears to do most of the work)
   git clean -fxd



Create a new remote repository 
=================================

git init
<Add a new file called README.md>
git add README.md
git commit -m "Adding the first file on the git-test repo"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/daniel-berger-hull/git-test.git
git push -u origin main

Note: This one appears to work only if you have an existing remove repo on GitHub (i.e git-test)
      (Oct 2023)Confirming again that the remote repository MUST be created before git push

Note 2:  The following push command appears to work also 
            git push --set-upstream origin master
        (-u is the short version of --set-upstream) 
        
        
Push an existing repository
===========================

git remote add origin https://github.com/daniel-berger-hull/git-test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
