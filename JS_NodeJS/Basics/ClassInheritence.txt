Multiple Inheritence (Mixin)
=============================

Javascript is not supporting for say Multiple Inheritence, but offer 
a mixin, which permits to add functions (and fields?) to a classe already defined 

Check the following web site:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-using-js-mixins

Example:

	//The swim property here is the mixin
	let swim = {
	  location() {
	    console.log(`Heading ${this.direction} at ${this.speed}`);
	  }
	};

	let Alligator = function(speed, direction) {
	  this.speed = speed,
	  this.direction = direction
	};
	
	class Reptile {
	    constructor(name) {
	      this.name = name;
	    }
	};

	//This add to the instance itself...
	let alligator = new Alligator('20 mph','North');
	alligator = Object.assign(alligator, swim);
	alligator.location();

  	// Modification on the class
  	Object.assign(Reptile.prototype, swim2);         //This one works!
        let alligator2 = new Reptile("alligator");
        alligator2.setSwimProperties("5 m/s", "upstream");
        alligator2.getSwimProperties();
