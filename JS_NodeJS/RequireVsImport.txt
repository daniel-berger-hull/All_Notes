There are 3 types of components/libs in NodeJS, and all depends system used

1 - CommonJS 
-------------
 --> Have to use a require('<libName>')
     (Will generate an error if we use import on those libs)


  All default NodeJS libs are CommonJS (fs, http, etc...)

  Works with no other config required on the NodeJS project

2 - ES6 (ECMAScript)
--------------------

 --> Have to use the import ...
  Most third party libs are based on ES6  
  Must define the NodeJS as a module

  Config: 
    run  npm init es6 -y
