General note:

The config file for npm is C:\Users\dxb160\.npmrc.
Make sure to:
  1 - Have a proxy 
      proxy=http://dxb160:<YourWinPassword>@proxy.OMEGA.DCE-EIR.NET:8080
      https-proxy=http://dxb160:<YourWinPassword>@proxy.OMEGA.DCE-EIR.NET:8080
   Note 1: 
       Plain characters works with npm (few are using a % based characters (like %65  --> 'a') for special char in the P.W
  
  2 - Have or don't have a registry
    For normal projects --> no registry , it will default to https://registry.npmjs.org/
    For CBSA projects --> registry = "https://artifactory.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.gc.ca/artifactory/api/npm/npm-dev/_auth = <base64 credentials>"

  To see your current registry settings -->  npm get registry

   *** I have to remove the registry to have it to work for normal nodejs projects
