NodeJS Modules (From Nodejs.org)

The community has produced a lot of module ready to use for helping
in most of the functions required in a project (access file, create HTTP server, encrypt data, create timers, etc)

Popular npm modules 
--------------------

Aside the regular NodeJS modules (section above), there are a lot of other modules who can be installed in a JavaScript/NodeJS 
environment
    npm install <packageToInstall>
    
  
  Popular one:
  	validator      --> A nice string validator and cleaner. A must of application requiring some text processing
  	
  	Postmen-request --> an HTTP Client
  	 Since it is deprecated you can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-request
  	 
  	 Use this web site to fake an REST JSON server: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ (From Maximellian's ReactJS course)
  	 
  	 
 
 WebGL & Three.js
 -----------------
 
   This is a must and have to be study, as the 3D drawing is as fast as with C++!
   
  GPU.js
  ------
  
  Check this lib, because it can also use the power of the GPU (transpile javascript into
  GPU language) and 
  
  GPU.js web:             https://gpu.rocks/#/
