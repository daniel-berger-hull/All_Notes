What Is HTML5?
==============


HTML5 is the current active specification for HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language.
HTML forms the content layer of the web, providing a way to structure information 
in a way that can be rendered by browsers and processed by search engine crawlers.
HTML5 was initially released in 2008, and has added additional features since then. 

It improves on earlier versions by enabling native multimedia content, support for 
SVG and MathML vector graphics, and new semantic document elements.
HTML is useful on its own, but much of its power is unlocked by the web’s 
other layers. CSS is the styling layer that determines how this content is displayed. 
JavaScript is the behavior layer that allows user interaction and dynamic data manipulation.
