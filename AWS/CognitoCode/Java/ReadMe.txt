Those are helper classes, that Mike found on the web, to create a  new user, confirm it 
and finally, validate any existing user.

The main class is UserService.java (the 2 other classes are only helper)

Note: Highly recommended to create a Java Maven project, and add the dependencies 
      contained in the pom.xml file
