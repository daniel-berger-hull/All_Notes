Create Shared Drive (VMWare Workstation)
===================================================

Problem:   Even if configured on the Host (Windows), it may happen that the shared drive doesn't show in the guess machine.

Test: 
run following command:
   vmware-hgfsclient
Expected Result: Should display the name of the shared
                 folder (but may not be accessible yet)

go to: 
   /mnt/hgfs folder
Expected Result: Should also display the shared folder

If Shared drive not visible 
  --> Potential problem with service mnt-hgfs...

 Check great article here:

Bascially:

1) Need those files to exist:
    /etc/systemd/system/mnt-hgfs.mount
    /etc/modules-load.d/open-vm-tools.conf
2) Need to have the mnt-hgfs defined an running
    Enable with: sudo systemctl enable mnt-hgfs.mount
    Start with:  sudo systemctl start mnt-hgfs.mount

Network Connection between 2 VM running on my Windows
=====================================================

#1 Use NAT interface
--------------------
   VM will be visible each others. The IPs will not be on the local network (Chimere Rooter), and have addresses in the 192.168.X.Y.
   But it will work

#2 Use Bridged or Other non NAT
-------------------------------
   A VM using a Bridged config will use an physical network device 
   (my WiFi USB card for instance ), and be visible on the LAN (Chimere) like any other device on the network

   But trying to connect to another VM (Bridged or not) will not work unless you create (on the Windows host):
    1) A Port forwarding Rule    (Using DOS netsh)
    2) A Firewall Rule            (Using Windows Defender Firewall app)
