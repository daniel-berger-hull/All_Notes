Usefull Switch
================

Switch       Description           			Example
------       ------------         			---------
-sP			Ping all network   			        nmap -sP 10.0.0.1/24
-sS			Ping Stealth				            nmap -sS -d 10.0.0.1/24
-p<Port>	Ping specific ports			      nmap -p22 10.0.0.1/24
										                    nmap -p22,80 10.0.0.1/24
-O          Try to identify OS			    nmap -O 10.0.0.1/24
-A           Detailed map **1: 			    nmap -A  10.0.0.10
-D           Map from Decoy**2 			    nmap -sS -D  10.0.0.200 10.0.0.10

**1	 Pull the OS version, Protocol version and a lot more
       Note: Faster to map only or few ips (not a full lan, like 10.0.0.1/24)
**2  Will look like another PC is mapping, not yours and 
      you may add the -sS also
     Note: in example the IP 10.0.0.200 is the decoy, 
     		and the 10.0.0.10 will be scanned


Scripting (nmap to run a script):
  Switch --> --scripts
    example: nmap --script vuln 10.0.0.10
Note: the 'vuln' above is one among the many scripts available
