NOTE: *** All details here are written using Timer2, but the very same details are exact for Timer0 also ***

Fast PWM vs Phase PWM

   i)  The fast PWM is direcly aligned with the value on the counter and the related Output Counter value
   ii) The Phase PWM (accourding to MaxEmbeded Web Site), would follow a triangle counter (0-255-0), so 
       would be 'centered' in the duty cycle, will the PWM is left aligned
       
Fast PWM Mode 3  vs 7

     In Mode 3, each channels are independent, and the duty cycle are controlled  by their respective 
     		Output Compare value
     				Channel A --> OCR2A --> Output on Pin PB3
				Channel B --> OCR2B --> Output on Pin PD3
	     The frequency of both channel is the same, and controlled by the prescalling set in the 
	     TCCR2B register (CS22,CS21,CS20)
     
     In mode 7, each output compare are used in pair to control the output.
     		The output compare A (OCR2A) control the frequency of the timer (counts from 0 to OCR2A)
     		The compare B (OCR2B) control the duty cycle
