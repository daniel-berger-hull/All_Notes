ESP-IDF
-------

I'm goint to use the Arduino framework for a while, because jumping tothe Espressif IDF is going to require a lot of commitement.
But the SDK on which Arduino appears to be build it here:

	C:\Users\dan\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\1.0.2\cores\esp32


SPIFFS
------

The ESP32 also has a support for the SPI File System (a small file system specific for the microcontroller having a flash)

Any file to be accessed by the microcontroller have to be updated in the Flash memory first,
so here is a good site that describe the process

Using Visual Studio Code with ESP32

Make sure that the following setting is done to have IntelliJ working and be able to compile from within VSC
