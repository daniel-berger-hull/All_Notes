Aside the Arduino's delay function, it is possible to tap into the Expressif-IDF code to implement a native delay function

For instance, the example here is using a MCU command of no operation

	#define NOP() asm volatile ("nop")

to slowdown the execution of a program.

To complement the delay function, it is needed to interogate the system about the system time,
so that the delay can know when to resume the execution of the program.
Function like:

		esp_timer_get_time()  and 
		micros()
		
Can help in this task
