Here is a step by step procedure

  https://www.arnabkumardas.com/platforms/rp2040/raspberry-pi-pico-create-and-build-new-project-in-windows-10/
  
Or you can 

1 - Extracts the folders and files from the PicoProjectTemplate.rar archive (to skip all the folder and files creation steps )

2 - Open a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt

    From the Windows search Textfield (bottom left of the screen, beside the Windows button)
			Enter 'developer command prompt'

   Note: You will need to use Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt AND NOT just a DOS prompt!!!

3 -  Navigate to the build folder of the project extracted in step 1

   i.e:  C:\data\Electronic\workspaces\rPI\pico\pico-empty-project\build
   
4 - Enter the cmake command 
               cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
           
               from within the build folder

5 - run nmake

 (Should give the .elf and .uf2 in the build\main folder)
