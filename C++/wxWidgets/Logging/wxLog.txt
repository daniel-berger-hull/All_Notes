=============

  The wxLogStream (log to a file of your choice) work ok
  
  Requires:
  
	  wxLog* mStandardLog;
  	  FILE* mLogfile;
  	  
  And the setup is:
  
   	 mLogfile = fopen("some.log", "w");
  	 mStandardLog = new wxLogStderr(mLogfile);
	 wxLog::SetActiveTarget(mStandardLog);
 
 And then, logging with call to:
 	wxLogMessage("Hello world from wxWidgets!");
