Web Debugging TypeScript with VS Code
======================================

But that have it to work, it is really complex...

Steps:

1 - NodeJS Project Create a NodeJs project   (npm init -y)
2 - Create an NodeJS Server
    Install NPM express and nocache    (npm install express nocache)
    Use the \TypeScriptDebuging\server.js code  
       (That is a really strange config, that server on public and root folder of your project.
       If YOU DON'T DO THAT, IT WILL NOT WORK!)
 3 - package.json
   Use the \TypeScriptDebuging\package.json file code  
  Some minor tweak, like on the script section will help

 4 - tsconfig.json
  Here, there are a lot of pitfall. 
 Make sure to  have 
    i)   The source map file for the debug        -->  "sourceMap": true,
    ii)  Use a source file for your .ts file      --> Here create a src folder, and add     "rootDir": "./src", 
    iii) Use an output folder (very convenient)   --> Here use /public, as it is a default folder for many web sever,   add "outDir": "./public",
    iv)  Put the right JS target (ES2015, ES6, CommonJS) -->   "target": "es2016" did work
    v)   Add an inclusion, to avoid warning with the server.js  -->  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
         (force to transpile only the Typescript files)
 
 5 - HTML file 
  The correct <Script synthax> in the HTML file
         --> <script type="module">
              import { helloWorld } from './index.js';
              helloWorld();
            </script> 
    Otherwise, the browser will give an error that you can't run imports into a non-module file


To Do:
   This method is very ugly. Work to fix the following:

   1 - Remove Serving 2 folders
    Remove the need to have a server that serves on 2 different folder (root and /public)
    The root is a patch, to make the browser able able to fetch the Typescript code and display it in the Browser's debug.
    It is due to the URL that the browser fetch the file, the htt

 Note:    This is from a YouTube video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3i9b3uK00U
 Note 2:  This require a NodeJS project (Still not found good way to debug web page) 
 
 1 - Install following library in your project with command:
  
        npm install --save-dev ts-node tsconfig-paths

 2 - Create VS VSCode launch file       
    i)  Click on left hand menu icon 'Run and Debug'
    ii)  Click on link 'create a launch.json file'
    iii) From top menu (appears when click on step ii) ), selecte 'NodeJS' 
    iv) Make sure that you have all the element in your launch.json file
