A compilation of piece of code or driver file that works on 

   * stm32f103C8T6(Small form factor board)
   * STM32F303VCT6 Discovery Board
   * STM32F406VG Discovery Board


*** Standard Library vs HAL ***

   The first STM32 projects been done using the early library, called STM32 Standard Peripheral Libraries.
   Those projects and lib were used with Attolic Studio or CooCox.
   
   But ST Electronic published the Tool STMCube, with a new generation of library HAL.
   Also Attolic is now part of STMCudeIDE, which is a combined Attolic IDE + STM Cube.
   My Last project used HAL.
   
   



Note on Programmation of the chip:
==================================

 STM32F103C8T6 Micro Board
 ---------------------------

 The stm32f103c8t6 will require the ST-Link 2 Adapter to be programmed via a USB port of the PC.
 4 wires required:


   #1 -->  Input/Output   
   #2 -->  Ground
   #3 -->  Clock
   #4 -->  3.3 V
   
 
 ST-Link 2 Connect view (When seeing the USB connector is away from you)

    (No writing on the top)
    +---------------+
    | 1  2  3  4  5 |
    | 6  7  8  9  A |

  STM32F303VCT6 & STM32F406VG Discovery Board
  ---------------------------
  
    The discovery board already has an ST-Link 2 included in the board (accessible
    via the USB connector)
