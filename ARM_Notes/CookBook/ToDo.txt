This is the aspect where there are a need to complete some code example. Since there are many
ST platform, it would rather be better to concenentrate only on the STM32F103 and STM32F404.

ADC
----

  F4 Using Polling 
  F4 Using Interupt 
  F4 With DMA transfer 

 --> The F103 has 3 types already

DMA
----

  F4 - Mem to mem (one existing already for the F3)
  
 
GPIO
----

   F103 - A PWM (Check CooCox examples has a good one: TIM_PWMOutput.c)
