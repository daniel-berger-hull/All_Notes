* Color LCD SSD1299
 	  This site has a driver that appears to work https://github.com/LonelyWolf/stm32 under
 	  the section ssd1289. The code indicates that it should work on an STM32F103, but
 	  that may require too much cabling with the board to be appropriate.
 	  May try to transpose the code for the F3 or F4 Disco.
   
   
* DMA transfer - Mem to Mem
 
 	I think I tried this one http://www.embedds.com/using-direct-memory-access-dma-in-stm23-projects/
 	and it worked fine.
 
* DMA Example on F3 (email on Gmail)
 	SAme as previous, but on a F3 Disco. Also, it appears to have a display on UART for debugging.
 

* Monochrome VGA on F103

 	This cool project http://www.artekit.eu/vga-output-using-a-36-pin-stm32/ connect a F103 board
 	to a VGA cable, and is acting as a simple VGA driver!
 
 	They even made a Space Invader using the same lib:

 * USB to PC
 
  This site as a very prominzing info about USB transfer with a PC
   http://www.emcu.it/STM32/STM32-USB-FS/USB-FSDeviceLibrary.html

   Also, I saved at the location 
                 D:\data\Electronic\STM32\Libs\USB-FS
   One of the core USB driver the site refers too...
   Will require a lot of reading and study, but may pay a lot once understood...
   
 * Analyse the ST Electronic Demos
  May have overlooked the demos from ST, and there may be some basics, but still very handy techniques and theory
  in there:

 * Good diagram on the Output Compare mechanism
 
 	 The compare operation used with timer specially is well described in this diagram.

 * Good page specialized on STM32F103 boards 
 
 	This site is very specific about using the F103 boards, not just the
 	clone eBay version (that we have to solder all the pins ourselves), 
 	but the older version (the first one I order some years ago)
