Using CooCox IDE:

1) Selection of the board/Microprocessor is mandatory
2) Following Peripheral libraries are either mandatory or highly desirable
   Must be selected from the Repository windows in CooCox IDE

Mandatory :
   CMSIS Boot -  The core libs for the board
   RCC - The clock code and code related to the reset function of the board (initial bootstrapping)
   GPIO - Most likely, application writes on a port pin, so this pulls the libraries required

High Desirable:
   Semihosting -  Make the communication with the CooCox IDE possible, via the USB port connected on the computer
   C Libraries - Convinent printf function (C style)

3) Modify the startup/startup_stm32FXXX.c
    Uncomment the  SystemInit() function in the function prototypes section of the file

 Right after the: 
	extern int main(void);           /*!< The entry point for the application.    */ 
 And before the:
       void Default_Reset_Handler(void


    In the Default_Reset_Handler(void)
        Add a call to  SystemInit();

4) Facultative-  Make the  PrintChar(char c) function operationnal
  
  The function's body is there, but there is no code that send chars to the output console.

  --> Add the call to SH_SendChar(c);

void PrintChar(char c)
{
	/* Send a char like: 
	   while(Transfer not completed);
	   Transmit a char;
	*/
	SH_SendChar(c);
}
